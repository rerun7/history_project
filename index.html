        <h1>The Democratic Republican Party</h1>
        <h2>If you want this country to prosper, then a Democratic-Republican party must be fostered.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Who We Are</h3>
        <p>We are a party made by and for the people. We stand with the everyday citizen to protect their rights in a
            battleground that they have been prevented from entering. We believe that the suggested political norms are
            ridiculous, and no one knows better how to run their country than the people themselves, not some
            aristocrats.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>What We Believe</h3>
        <p>First and foremost, if we are going to establish a form of government, we as a country need to use it, not
            push
            it aside. We founded states for the sake of preventing a monarchy, and we plan to continue using them. We
            believe in our constiution, which we wrote for the sake of the people and no one else, and we believe that
            we
            should follow that, so long as the peoples rights are ensured through a Bill of Rights. We want a financial
            system that works, not one that might. The proposal of a nationally run bank is a threat to our democracy
            and
            should be thought of as one. We believe in an economy of farmers, our hardest workers, and we want to keep
            them
            in a state of prosper, not take it away with tax. All basic civil liberties of anyone wanting to live in
            this
            country. Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Our Founders</h3>
        <p>We were founded by and are still lead by Thomas Jefforson and James Madison. Thomas Jefforson, the past
            Ambassador to France and present Secretary of State, is one of our greatest assets and we are extremely
            greatful
            to have him. James Madison, one of the strongest defendants of the consitution through his work on the
            Federalist papers, he continues to defend our civil liberties to this day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h3>Our Opposition</h3>
        <p>Our main oppsition is the Federalist Party, lead by Alexander Hamilton. They opposed the Bill of Rights,
            tried to
            enforce the President having a lifelong term, and want the federal government to have complete control. To
            them
            we say, what was the point of breaking off from Britan if we are just going to have a monarchy again? Do you
            think it wise? Effective? It is none of those things, and just causes discourse among the people. If you
            want to
            see the country prosper, you first have to use the systems we put in place. States are here for a reason,
            and
            for a nation of the people we should be asking them to help, not just putting them off to the side.</p>
